# Introduction (Slide 1)
My name is 'name', I'm on the Ideal team along with 'team names', and the app we're developing is called Parkmaster.
## Story (Slide 2)
Raise your hand if you drive yourself to campus. Keep your hand up if you've ever been later than you thought to campus because of icy roads, and late to class because the only available spots to park at were really far down.
