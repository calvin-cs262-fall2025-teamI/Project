	Our parking app aims to be marketable software for creating parking lot blueprints from existing parking lots, creating designated parking spots for employees, and overall saving time for company and private parking management alike.
	The two main features of this app will be to create basic parking lot layouts and create designated parking schedules. Our layouts will aim to reflect real world dimensions and include different sizes of parking spots as well as specific labels for disabled and reserved parking.
	Parking apps and software fall primarily into two categories, apps that help you find parking, and apps that help companies manage their parking. Our app will fall into the latter option.
