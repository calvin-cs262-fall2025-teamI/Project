# Parkmaster

## Vision Statement

Parkmaster is a software solution designed for companies and organizations that manage private or employee parking lots. Unlike parking apps such as SpotHero or ParkWhiz, which focus on helping drivers find available public parking, Parkmaster belongs to the category of parking management software used by businesses to design, allocate, and oversee their parking resources.

Some existing tools, like Parkalot, already allow managers to create visual layouts of parking lots and manage permits or reservations. However, Parkalot and similar apps often stop short of offering a comprehensive scheduling system that integrates both lot design and employee spot assignments.

Parkmaster enables parking managers to create accurate parking lot blueprints that reflect real-world dimensions, including specialized parking for handicapped spaces and reserved employee spaces. Beyond layout design, Parkmaster will also provide tools for creating parking schedules and designations, such as assigning specific spots to employees, departments, or visitors.

Parkmaster will also provide users quick and easy access to their assigned parking areas or spots. Once signed in, a User will be able to swiftly find the parking spot they're looking for, whether it is an assigned spot or area, and they can see how full certain parking lots are. Lastly, they will also be able to view their account details, including username and password information, and cars registered to their account.

By simplifying layout planning and automating scheduling, Parkmaster will save time and operational effort for parking lot managers, users, and companies as a whole, ensuring both efficiency and fairness in parking resource allocation.
